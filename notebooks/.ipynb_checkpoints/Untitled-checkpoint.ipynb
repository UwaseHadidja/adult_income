    "# UCI Adult Income Dataset - Exploratory and Descriptive Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we carry out an in-depth exploratory and descriptive analysis of the UCI Adult Income Dataset, a widely used dataset for income prediction tasks based on individual demographic and employment attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "This phase of analysis is essential for uncovering patterns, detecting potential biases, and gaining intuition about the datasetâ€™s structure before applying any modelling procedures. We examine the distribution of key numerical and categorical variables, investigate relationships between demographic features and income levels, and use visualizations to summarize insights. Particular focus is placed on income disparities across **age groups**, **geographical regions**, **races**, and **education-occupation combinations**, helping lay a solid foundation for downstream modeling and policy-relevant interpretation."

    "This summary provides a snapshot of key distribution characteristics. We see that:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Age ranges from 17 to 90, with a mean of 38.6 years. It is slightly right-skewed (positively skewed). While the average age is approximately 38.6 years, an examination of the percentiles reveals that the majority of individuals are clustered in the younger to middle-age range, with fewer observations in the older age brackets. This skewed age distribution might suggest labor force participation is concentrated in specific age groups, which could reflect broader demographic or economic realities.\n",
    "- Capital gains/losses are highly skewed, with most values at 0 (the 75th percentile is 0). This indicates that a small number of individuals report very large gains or losses, especially evident in the capital gain variable which reaches up to $99,999. These variables act as proxies for wealth-related income that goes beyond regular wages or salaries. Individuals with non-zero values for capital gains or losses often represent a distinct socioeconomic subset of the population â€” typically more financially literate, or with access to investment assets. The stark inequality in their distributions mirrors real-world disparities in asset ownership and investment returns.\n",
    "- The dataset has individuals working anywhere from 1 to 99 hours per week, with a median of 40. This aligns with the standard full-time work week in many countries (8 hours per day for 5 working days). The mean is slightly above that at 40.4 hours, suggesting a mild right skew, with a small subset of individuals working significantly longer hours. The mode is also 40, further reinforcing the prevalence of full-time work. A non-trivial number of individuals report working very few hours, possibly due to part-time work, unemployment, or semi-retirement. On the other extreme, some report working more than 45 hours per week, which may indicate multiple jobs, weekend-work, self-employment, or informal labor, and could reflect socioeconomic necessity."

    "Secondary-school graduates form the largest educational group (~32%), highlighting the central role of high school completion in the labor force. Tertiary education holders â€” those with university or equivalent degrees â€” account for nearly 25% of the population, representing a substantial segment with advanced qualifications. A notable 22.4% have attended some college without necessarily earning a degree, suggesting that partial post-secondary education is common, yet may not always translate into formal certification. The remaining 20% are distributed among those with only secondary education (9.4%), associate degrees (7.5%), primary school (3.5%), and a very small group with only preschool education (0.15%). It is ecident that the education distribution is skewed toward mid- to high-level education, with relatively few individuals having only basic schooling. This reflects a dataset that largely captures working-age adults in formal labor, which may underrepresent the least-educated populations.\n",

    "`occupation_grouped`\n",
    "\n",
    "White-collar occupations are the most prevalent (~51%), followed by blue-collar, service, and unknown. Smaller categories include military, which is marginal. Essentially, slightly over half of individuals in the dataset work in professional, managerial, sales, clerical, or tech-support roles. This suggests the dataset is heavily weighted toward professional and administrative occupations. Nearly a third of the population works in manual labor or skilled trade positions (craft, transport, machine operation, farming, etc.). This indicates a significant segment engaged in physically intensive or technical labor.\n",

    "The largest groups are 26â€“35 and 36â€“45, followed by 46â€“60. These three age groups represent about 73% of the dataset. Very few individuals are under 18 or above 75, consistent with the dataset's focus on the working-age population."

For the 26-35 age group, there's a noticeable improvement â€” roughly 1 in 5 individuals in this group earn >50K, reflecting early career progression and accumulation of qualifications/experience. A substantial income increase is seen in the 36-45 age group: over a third now earn >50K. This is typically considered prime earning age where individuals settle into stable, higher-paying positions. Highest proportion of >50K earners is seen amongst individuals aged between 46 and 60â€” nearly 4 in 10. This reflects career maturity, peak seniority levels, and accumulated experience. There's a drop-off in high incomes as many transition to retirement, part-time, or less demanding roles in the age group 61-75. Yet about 1 in 4 still earn >50K. Most in 76+ age group earn <=50K, likely due to retirement, pensions, or fixed incomes â€” but a small minority still earn higher incomes, possibly through continued work or investments."
